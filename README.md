You need to have your environment set up for react native development.
see https://reactnative.dev/

In the root of the project run `yarn` to install all node modules
Run `cd ./ios && pod install` to install iOS dependencies
Run `yarn ios` to compile and run the iOS simulator and install the app
If you have and android emulator running you can use the app there with `yarn android`
